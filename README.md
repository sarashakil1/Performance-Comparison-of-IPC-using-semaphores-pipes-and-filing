## Objective:
Our main objective of this project is to implement inter process communication using filling, pipes and semaphores and the compare their performance.

## Methodology
We used linear searching on 50000 numbers as a task to implement interprocess communication in order to  learn about the working and handling of large data by different methodologies of Inter  process communications and to get clear idea of the performance of each type of IPC method so that we can compare them later on and do the analysis.
